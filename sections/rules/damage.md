### Damage

#### Armour

Where reasonable, **Armour** reduces the damage taken by a hit. The amount is listed with the armour description. For example, **Leather Jerkin (Armour 1)** would reduce the damage to Stamina by **1**. Typically, **Armour** comes as **Light (1)**, **Medium (2)**, or **Heavy (3)**. **Magic Armour** may offer stronger protection.
