### Tests

When a significant outcome is unclear a **Test** can be called. The player rolls a number of **d6** equal to an appropriate **Skill** . If they roll at least one **6**, they succeed. If they have no appropriate skill, roll **2d6** and take the lowest. Do not call for Tests too often.

#### Advantage

Sometimes conditions will be favourable, or characters will be well-prepared or -equipped. In these situations the GM can award **Advantage**. When you make a Test with Advantage roll an additional **d6**.

#### Disadvantage

Conversely, sometimes situations will be unfavourable or a character unprepared, and the GM will penalise a roll with **Disadvantage**. When you make a Test with Disadvantage roll one less **d6**.

Advantage and Disadvantage do not stack and cancel each other out.
