### Attacks

When you **Attack** a target, make a [Contest](contests.md) using a relevant combat [Skill](../careers/skills.md) (**Bash**, **Shoot**, **Slash**, or **Stab**).

If you win the Attack you deal damage to your opponent's [Stamina](../fools/stamina.md). If you fail, they launch a counter-attack and damage you. The amount of damage depends on the Skills used:

| Skills   | Damage               |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Bashing  | **2d6** **(lowest)** |
| Shooting | **1d6**              |
| Slashing | **2d6 (highest)**    |
| Stabbing | **1d6**              |
