### Luck

[Fools](../fools/index.md) can spend a point of **Luck** to escape death. Whenever failure could spell disaster, Fortune intervenes and spares the Fool by some unlikely happenstance. Luck cannot be recovered. Once it's spent, it's gone forever and you're **Out of Luck**. It's time for your character to retire, before it's too late.
