## Fools

Each player controls a **Fool**, an individual of poor luck or wits drawn into unlikely circumstances beyond their control. Fools are defined by [Careers](careers.md), [Skills](skills.md), [Stamina](stamina.md), [Luck](../rules/luck.md), [Wages](wages.md) and [Trappings](trappings.md).

To create a character follow these steps:

1. Fools start with **3d6 (2 lowest) Wages**, **1 Small Knife**, clothes and boots.
2. Fools start with **12 Stamina**.
3. Fools start with **3 Luck**.
4. Fools must choose a [Career](careers.md).
   - You must possess all the **Trappings** of the career.
   - You can purchase the Trappings for a career with your **Wages**.
   - You gain the **Skills** and [Stamina](stamina.md) of your career and roll for its Wages.
   - You can move between careers for as long as you have the Wages to do so.
   - You cannot take the same Career twice.
