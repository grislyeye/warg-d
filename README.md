# Vellum Book

A template project for publishing rich web documents. Very much a work-in-progress at this time, use with caution.

**[Demo](https://grislyeye.github.io/vellum-book/)** |
**[Roadmap](https://github.com/grislyeye/vellum-book/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement)**

Features:

- Write everything in plain markdown files
- Rich document view with [`<vellum-doc>`](https://github.com/grislyeye/vellum-doc)
- Link previews with [`<link-preview>`](https://github.com/rg-wood/link-preview) (not working)
- Smartly converts links between markdown files into fragment links (e.g. [Chapter 1](sections/chapter-1/chapter-1.md))
- Beautifully themed with [magick.css](https://css.winterveil.net/) by default
