# Wargöd!

**Wargöd!** is a rules-lite roleplaying game of grubby fantasy, inspired by games like _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_, _Warlock!_ and _Kriegmesser_. It is designed to be compatible with _Troika!_ And _Fighting Fantasy_.

The **Game** consists of [Fools](sections/fools/fools.md), [Rules](sections/rules/rules.md) and [The World](sections/world/world.md). You just need some paper, pencils and a handful of six-sided dice to get started.
