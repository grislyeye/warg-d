# Wargöd!

**Wargöd!** is a rules-light RPG of grubby fantasy based loosely on **Fighting Fantasy**, **Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay** and **Kriegmesser**.

The **Game** consists of [Fools](sections/fools/fools.md), [Rules](sections/rules/rules.md) and [The World](sections/world/world.md). All you need to play are some paper, pencils and a handful of six-sided dice.
