# Wargöd!

**Wargöd!** is a rules-lite roleplaying game of grubby fantasy, inspired by games like *Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay*, *Warlock!* and *Kriegmesser*. It is designed to be compatible with *Troika!* And *Fighting Fantasy*.

The **Game** consists of [Fools](sections/fools/fools.md), [Rules](sections/rules/rules.md) and [The World](sections/world/world.md). You just need some paper, pencils and a handful of six-sided dice to get started.
